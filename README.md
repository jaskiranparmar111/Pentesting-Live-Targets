# Project 9 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
it was a litte difficult being able to get the script the work due to a lot of people other's scripts on the website. Also some links directed to different websites that made the whole website completely unuseable.
